# The Story of the Unicorn

# The unicorn was walking in the forest when he saw a hunter and started to gallop at the speed of sound but the sound was faster and the unicorn tried to zigzag to avoid the bullets and she succeeded.

"Haha," the unicorn laughed. But the hunter was furious and not known for giving up. 
He had a go for the second time. 

The unicorn laughed again becuase the unicorn speed was to faster and the unicorn tried to zigzag to avoid the all bullets coming from the hunter.
Hunter tried many times but he missed everytimes. I don't know which techniques he try?
