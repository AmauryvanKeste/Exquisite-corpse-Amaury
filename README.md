# The Story of the Unicorn

The unicorn was walking in the forest when he saw a hunter and started to gallop at the speed of sound but the sound was faster and the unicorn tried to zigzag to avoid the bullets and she succeeded.

"Haha," the unicorn laughed. But the hunter was furious and not known for giving up.
He had a go for the second time. "Without fault"

The unicorn laughed again because the unicorn's speed was too fast and the unicorn tried to zigzag to avoid all the bullets shot by the hunter.
The hunter tried many times but he missed each shot. I don't know which techniques he used?
